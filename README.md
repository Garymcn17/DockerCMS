# Description
Cloud computing Assignment 2 repository. We were required to create a docker swarm with one manager and two workers. Create a docker container management service using restful api that will manage containers, images and stacks. We then had to run NGINX as a service on the swarm that we could access through the external IP address of the manager. Then write a python program that tested our API .----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Run python container-server.py in the mangager ssh.
Cd into the LASTGO directory
Cd into the Assignment folder
Run the server.

Open another manager ssh and run the test.py.
Cd into the LASTGO directory
Cd into the Assignment folder
This creates a menu which will give you instructions on how to interact with the server.
Just follow this menu and everything should work.
